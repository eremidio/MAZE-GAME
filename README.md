# MAZE-GAME
A SIMPLE MAZE GAME DONE IN C++. THIS GAME WAS DONE AS AN EXERCISE IN LOGIC JUST TO CREATE A VERY SIMPLE MAZE GENERATION ALGORITHM. THIS WAS ACHIEVED BY USING A RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR TO DEFINE MOTION IN ALL 4 DIRECTIONS CONCERNING VON NEUMANN CONCEPT OF NIGHBOURHOOD, DEFINING THE INITIAL AND END POSITIONS. IT DOESN'T PROVIDE A PERFECT MAZE IN EVERY ATTEMPT BUT IT PROVIDES A NICE CHALLENGE MOST OF THE TIME. 


AN ALTERNATTIVE ALGORITHM TO CREATE MAZE WAS PROVIDED. IT ALSO DOESN'T PROVIDE A PERFECT MAZE IN EVERY ATTEMPT BUT IT PROVIDES A NICE CHALLENGE MOST OF THE TIME.
