# MAZE-GAME
A SIMPLE MAZE GAME DONE IN C++. THIS GAME WAS DONE AS AN EXERCISE IN LOGIC JUST TO CREATE A VERY SIMPLE MAZE GENERATION ALGORITHM. THIS WAS ACHIEVED BY USING A RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR TO DEFINE MOTION IN ALL 4 DIRECTIONS CONCERNING VON NEUMANN CONCEPT OF NIGHBOURHOOD, DEFINING THE INITIAL AND END POSITIONS. THIS DOESN'T PROVIDE A PERFECT MAZE IN ANY ATTEMPT BUT IT PROVIDES A NICE CHALLENGE MOST OF THE TIME. OTHER NICE APPROACH WOULD BE USING ONLY TWO DIRECTIONS OF MOTION (RANDOM VARIABLE TAKING VALUES 0 AND 1) TO CREATE A PERFECT PATH FROM START TO THE END, AND THEN USING A RANDOM VARIABLE TO WEIGH THE REMAINING WALLS OF THE MAZE PROVIDING AN EXTRA DIFFICULTY TO THE PLAYER.
